This folder contains test cases specific to this exercise.

These test cases should
    1. ALL return the correct tokens in the *.ok files 
    2. NOT return the correct tokens in the *.bad files
    3. exit with "Lexical error" in *.lexical-error files
    4. exit with a custom message in *.invalid-date files

For *.ok files, if you added the token "T_NUM" for this exercise,
then 01.ok should return:
T_NUM
T_NUM
T_NUM
T_NUM

If there are 4 lines in 01.ok, then the output should also contain
4 lines, otherwise the test case failed even if the correct
token is returned.

The *.bad files contain test cases which should not return the correct token.
A single test case can return 2 or more tokens, in which case it will be 
considered incorrect even if it is the desired token being returned:
12  ->  T_NUM
        T_NUM

Example for *.lexical-error file output:
T_NUM
T_ID
Line 2: Lexical error

Side note:
    1. These tests check the isolated correctness of your solution, they do not check whether it has broken the program in other places.
    2. These tests might not capture all the cases, if you are doubtful of your solution, always add more test cases.
